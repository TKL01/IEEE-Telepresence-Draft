\begin{abstract}

Collision prediction and avoidance is essential for the autonomous navigation of mobile robots. A transversability map is a way to achieve this objective. However, this approach might fail when the environment is subject to  dynamic motion of living or artificial entities. Included are pedestrians, animals, and other vehicles that the robot cannot handle. In this paper, we  embrace this challenge by achieving a flexible human-robot teaming that leverages a shared control of the robot. A human operator can remotely supervise and actively guide the robot as well as  share or leave full control to the robot that autonomously moves toward a desired goal. For this purpose, a situation-aware control signal balances the input of the autonomous robot and the cognitive input of the  remote human operator. The robot employs a  transversability map to autonomously evolve in unstructured environments. In critical situations, the human operator can  intervene and seamlessly operate the robot from everywhere by using any web-capable device.  Such a human-in-the-loop control is realized through a bidirectional wireless communication between the physical robot and its multi-modal digital twin.  The human-robot teaming enhances the likeliness of a successful navigation even without pre-defined goal and dynamics obstacles. The paper outlines the conceptual architecture and shares preliminary results of our approach.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
The navigation of mobile robot in unstructured environments requires the detection, interpretation, and avoidance of obstacles. Combining  RGB and depth images, semantic segmentation,  intrinsic and extrinsic  camera parameters to predict a bird's-eye-view transversability map is an approach to cope with obstacle during navigation \cite{wayfaster,wayfast,endo2024benchnav}. Self-supervised learning is leveraged to train a model that predicts the transferability map from  images forwarded as inputs. The map is obtained as an array of scalar parameters that describe the linear and angular transversability for each point in the Cartesian operational space of the robot  \cite{wayfaster,wayfast,leung2022hybrid,endo2024benchnav}. 

A transversability map can capture the semantics obstacles \cite{wayfaster,wayfast,leung2022hybrid}. Transversable tall grasses can thereby be dissociated from a stiff wall with the same height during collision interpretation. In this case, the reachable workspace of the robot is enlarged in contrast to approaches that adopt a purely geometrical collision handling. Autonomous navigation benefits from such a skillful decision. Even though the underlying camera-image based neural networks for  transversability prediction excel in a static environment, they are constrained in dynamic and busy environments where people, animals or other objects such as cars are moving, too. Furthermore, not all parameters can be taken into account in these models. Parameters such as battery state of charge (SoC) or engine temperatures of the robot are equally important to ensure successful and safe navigation. It is therefore common for robots to be additionally teleoperated by a human operator. However, teleoperation might require the constant attention of the operator, which prevents the operator from accomplishing other tasks parallel.




In this paper, we focus on a collaborative interaction between a  robot and its remote operator  for a  robot navigation with a customized level of human intervention and robot autonomy. Situational awareness and  supervision skills of humans help guide and assist the robot in challenging situations. Conversely, the autonomous navigation abilities of the robot allow its human operator to focus on additional tasks while the robot moves around toward the completion of a desired common objective. Between this full guidance and entire autonomy, cognitive skills of the human operator (e.g., perception, empathy, anticipation) can superimposed on top of decisions of the motion planner of the robot to refine and adjust the behavior of the robot and facilitate its navigation. This approach is likely to raise the success rate of navigation ob by addressing and combining the skillsets of humans and robots in a seamless and dynamic way.

\end{figure}

We  provide the robot operator with a web-based graphical unit accessible from most devices. The unit interfaces the robot through its digital twin, reflects the perception of the internal state of the robot and its surroundings as live video streams, visualizes its critical data, and offers multiple control options at e.g. velocity level. We strive to use  velocity signals from the motion planer of the mobile robot and the unit to realize a shared control \cite{phri} of the robot based upon human-robot teaming. In this case, the level of autonomous  behavior of the robot and amount of human intervention are  balanced by an arbitration factor that depends upon the transversability of the robot in real-time. Security aspects such as login and persistent data storage via a database are also integrated. 


\section{Web Framework}

The web framework is based on flask \cite{flask} and is used to control and monitor the Husky, which runs on ROS2 Humble and is platform-independent. 
Bidirectional communication between human and the robot is provided by the rosbridge\_suite package \cite{rosbridgeSuite}.   
Due to the web-based approach, all devices with a browser can access the app, provided they are in the same local network as the robot.
Fig. \ref{fig:userapp} shows the backend architecture, ROS packages and other relevant information which were leveraged for developing the framework. 
A twist message, which consists of angular and linear velocity, can be sent from the webpage (fronend) via e.g. 
a virtual joystick to the /cmd\_vel topic of the robot to set it in motion. The ros data published by the robot is in turn displayed on the app (see Fig. \ref{fig:overviewplots}).

\begin{figure}[b]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=8.9cm]{images/ROS_Web_App_Architecture.pdf}}
    \caption{Backend architecture of the web app and tools used.}
    \label{fig:userapp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Control panel}
The control panel in Fig. \ref{fig:clip} shows a live image stream (in the center) of a Zed2i camera attached on the Husky. Above the camera image, a navigation bar is located. 
Below the camera image there is a speed slider and two control elements such as a virtual joystick and virtual keyboard keys for controlling the Husky. 
In addition, the Husky can be controlled with a physical keyboard when the operator has access to the control panel. Keyboard control can be helpful in situations where precision is required compared to the joystick.
Other elements such as the battery SoC and the WebSocket connection are also shown embedded in the navigation bar.

%     \label{fig:controlpanel}
% \end{figure}
\subsection{Data panel}
The data panel in Fig. \ref{fig:overviewplots} shows critical live robot data such as the left and right motor temperatures as gauges. 
Furthermore, the temperatures and the battery SoC are shown in diagrams with time progression. 
The data for the visualization is provided by an SQLite database, which in turn reads the data from the respective ROS topics of the Husky. 
It is possible to select and visualize individual days in the diagrams and snapshots can be taken if required.

\end{figure*}



\subsection{Additional features and Result}
Additional features of the framework include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item User login system for security purposes
\item Visualization of the Husky 3D model 
\item Database connection with a specially developed OPC-UA server, to store other robot data apart from the Husky
\end{itemize}
Bootstrap, a frontend framework, was leveraged to facillitate responsive web design \cite{bootstrap}. 
This allows control elements and data visualizations to be optimally displayed on mobile or desktop devices of the robot operator and ensures that the robot operator retains an overview and control of the robot.






\section{RELATED WORK}
% Geometric navigation approaches that are for example LiDAR based, are especially limited outdoors \cite{wayfast}.
% Self-supervised navigation systems such as BADGR \cite{BADGR}, WayFAST \cite{wayfast} or the successor model WayFASTER \cite{wayfaster}, are therefore used to estimate the traversability with regard to bumps and navigable objects such as tall grass.
% Even though they excel in a static environment, they are constrained in a dynamic and busy environment where people or other objects such as cars are moving.
% For that reason 
- Shared Autonomy
- Presentation of BADGR and WayFASTER
- Web based UI Apps?



\section{Methodology and Concept}
We propose a shared autonomy approach of the guidance of a robot such as the Husky UGV from Clearpath. 
The idea is to let the robot take over initial control through a self-supervised navigation system such as WayFASTER.
The kino-dynamic model of a skid-steered Robot, such as the Husky, is given below: \cite{wayfaster}
% by \eqref{eq:kino-model} \cite{wayfaster}.

%     =

%         p_{x_k} \\
%         p_{y_k} \\
%         \theta_k
%     \end{bmatrix}
%     +
%     \begin{bmatrix}
%         \mu \cdot cos(\theta_k) & 0 \\
%         \mu \cdot sin(\theta_k) & 0  \\
%         0 & \nu
%     \end{bmatrix}
%     \begin{bmatrix}
%         v_k \\
%         \omega_k
%     \end{bmatrix}
%     \cdot \Delta t
%     \label{eq:kino-model}
% \end{equation}

    \resizebox{0.95\hsize}{!}{%
        % $\begin{bmatrix}

        %     p_{y_{k+1}} \\
        %     \theta_{k+1}
        % \end{bmatrix}
        $x_{k+1}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            p_{x_k} \\
            p_{y_k} \\
            \theta_k
        \end{bmatrix}
        +
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \mu(p_{x_k}, p_{y_k}) \cdot cos(\theta_k) & 0 \\
            \mu(p_{x_k}, p_{y_k}) \cdot sin(\theta_k) & 0  \\ 
            0 & \nu(p_{x_k}, p_{y_k})
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            v_k \\
            \omega_k
        \end{bmatrix}$
    }
    \label{eq:kino-model}
\end{equation*}

where $x_k$ is the state vector, $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the coordinates and $\theta_k$ is the orientation (heading angle) of the robot. 
The $cos(\theta_k)$ and $sin(\theta_k)$ functions describe the movement in x- and y-Axis depending on the orientation.
$\mu(p_x,p_y)$ and $\nu(p_x,p_y)$ are outputs (traversability coefficients) of the WayFASTER model TravNet and have a value between 1 and 0 respectively.
They indicate how well the robot can move across the terrain and are associated with the control inputs $v_k$ and $\omega_k$, which are the linear and angular velocities. 
In ROS terms are these are what a Twist Message contains.

We plan to integrate the transversability coefficients into our web framework. Since these coefficients have a value of 1 for good transversability and 0 for poor transversability, a threshold can be specified. 
A value of 0 (for both coefficients) would mean that the robot stops. To ensure a more seamless transition from autonomous control to human control, falling below the defined threshold will result in a warning in the web app.
This is intended to indicate the human operator to take control within the app. The app is programmed in such a way that human input always has top priority. Specifically, this can be achieved with Husky by sending control commands (geometry\_msgs/Twist\_Message) in different topics with different priorities \cite{controlpriority}. 

%Vom Wayfaster Paper: "The estimator uses the discrete system model shown in \eqref{eq:kino-model} and synchronously runs with the GNSS module on the robot at a sampling time $\Delta t$. We solve the following finite horizon optimization formulation to obtain the system states and unknown parameters $\mu$ and $\nu$."
